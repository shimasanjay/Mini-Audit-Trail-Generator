# Mini-Audit-Trail-Generator


A full-stack **Next.js** application that tracks text changes and automatically generates an audit trail. Each time the user saves content, the system creates a new version with a detailed diff showing:

- Added words  
- Removed words  
- Content length  
- Timestamp  
- Full saved content  

This project demonstrates frontend development, API creation, version tracking logic, and clean UI design — suitable for internship and full-stack evaluation tasks.
